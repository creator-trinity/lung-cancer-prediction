# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a lung cancer prediction project developed by a team of four members: Aayush Gid (Btech EC), Vikas Pal (Btech CS IT), Sourabh Pawar (Btech CS IT), and Muskan Suryavanshi (Btech IT). The project aims to predict lung cancer from medical images using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Train and evaluate a deep learning model using the EfficientNetB7 architecture for lung cancer prediction.
- Develop a Jupyter notebook (model_training.ipynb) for model training and evaluation.
- Implement a Streamlit app (streamlit_app.py) for the user interface to predict lung cancer.
- Create a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React.js to host the prediction service.
- Include additional files such as research paper, presentation slides, leaflet, videos, business plan, and project report for documentation and demonstration purposes.

## File Structure

- **models/**: Folder for storing trained models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
- **src/**: Source code for the Streamlit app and other components.
- **website/**: Files for the website interface.
- **resources/**: Additional resources including research paper, presentation slides, leaflet, videos, business plan, and project report.
- **documents/**: Business plan, project report, and other related documents.
- **tinyml/**: Files related to deploying the model on edge devices.
